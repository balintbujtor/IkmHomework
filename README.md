# IkmHomework
This project was made for the Ipari Képfeldolgozás és Megjelenítés (Industrial Image Processing and Display) course as an elective homework.

For the homework I had to implement a configurable deep neural network and I had to train it on a set of traffic signs provided by the university.
After the training, I had to run a Bayesian optimisation to find the best parameter set and compare the results of the optimized network and the original one.

For the submission, I had to make a report and a presentation.

The report is available [here](https://github.com/balintbujtor/IkmHomework/blob/main/documents/H%C3%A1zi%20feladat%20dokument%C3%A1ci%C3%B3.pdf), and it is written in Hungarian.

The presentation can be viewed [here](https://github.com/balintbujtor/IkmHomework/blob/main/documents/H%C3%A1zi%20feladat%20prezent%C3%A1ci%C3%B3.pptx).
